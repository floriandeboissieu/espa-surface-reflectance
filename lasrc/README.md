See git tag [version_3.0.0]

### Installation
  * Install dependent libraries - ESPA product formatter (https://eroslab.cr.usgs.gov/lsrd/espa-product-formatter.git)
  * Set up environment variables.  Can create an environment shell file or add the following to your bash shell.  For C shell, use 'setenv VAR "directory"'.
```
    export PREFIX="path_to_directory_for_lasrc_build_data"
```

  * Install baseline auxiliary files and set up the environment variables.
```
    tar -xvzf lasrc_auxiliary.2013-2017.tar.gz
    export LASRC_AUX_DIR="directory_saved_auxiliary_files"
    (or in c shell use 
    setenv LASRC_AUX_DIR "directory_saved_auxiliary_files")
```

  * Install the MSILUT files for the Sentinel-2 processing. Untar the MSILUT.tar.gz file into $LASRC\_AUX\_DIR.
```
    tar -xvzf MSILUT.tar.gz
```

  * Download (from Github USGS-EROS surface-reflectance project) and install source files. The following build will create a list of executable files under $PREFIX/bin (tested in Linux with the gcc compiler). It will also copy various scripts from the scripts directory up the the $PREFIX/bin directory.
```
    cd lasrc\c_version\src
    make
    make install
    make clean

    cd lasrc\landsat_aux\src
    make
    make install
    make clean
```

  * Test - Download Landsat Level 1 files.  Run the do\_lasrc Python script in the PREFIX bin directory to run the applications.  Use do\_lasrc.py --help for the usage information.  This script requires that your LaSRC binaries are in your $PATH or that you have a $BIN environment variable set up to point to the PREFIX bin directory.
```
    convert_lpgs_to_espa --mtl <Landsat_MTL_file>
    do_lasrc.py --xml <Landsat_ESPA_XML_file>
```

  * Check output
```
    {scene_name}_toa_*: top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (or brightness temperature for thermal bands) in internal ESPA file format
    {scene_name}_sr_*: surface reflectance in internal ESPA file format
```

  * Note that the FORTRAN version contains the code as delivered from Eric Vermote and team at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.  The C version contains the converted FORTRAN code into C to work in the ESPA environment.  It also contains any bug fixes, agreed upon by Eric's team, along with performance enhancements.  The FORTRAN code contains debugging and validation code, which is not needed for production processing.

### Dependencies
  * Python >= 3.6.X
  * ESPA raw binary and ESPA common libraries from ESPA product formatter and associated dependencies
  * XML2 library
  * Auxiliary data products
    1. LAADS Terra and Aqua CMG and CMA data
    2. CMGDEM HDF file
    3. Various input files and model information provided with the LaSRC auxiliary .tar.gz file

### Auxiliary Data Updates
The baseline auxiliary files provided don't include the daily climate data.  In order to generate or update the auxiliary files to the most recent day of year (actually the most current auxiliary files available will be 2-3 days prior to the current day of year do to the latency of the underlying LAADS products) the user will want to run the updatelads.py script available in $PREFIX/bin.  This script can be run with the "--help" argument to print the usage information.  In general the --quarterly argument will reprocess/update all the LAADS data back to 2013.  This is good to do every once in a while to make sure any updates to the LAADS data products are captured.  The --today command-line argument will process the LAADS data for the most recent year.  In general, it is suggested to run the script with --quarterly once a quarter.  Then run the script with --today on a nightly basis.  This should provide an up-to-date version of the auxiliary input data for LaSRC.  The easiest way to accomplish this is to set up a nightly and quarterly cron job.

NASA GSFC has deprecated the use of ftp access to their data.  The updatelads script uses a public https interface.  Scripted downloads need to use LAADS app keys in order to be properly authorized.  Non-ESPA environments will need to obtain an app key for the LAADS DAAC and add that key to the 'TOKEN' variable at the top of the updatelads.py script.  ESPA environments will be able to run the updatelads.py script as-is.

### Data Preprocessing
This version of the LaSRC application requires the input Landsat products to be in the ESPA internal file format.  After compiling the product formatter raw\_binary libraries and tools, the convert\_lpgs\_to\_espa command-line tool can be used to create the ESPA internal file format for input to the LaSRC application.

### Data Postprocessing
After compiling the product-formatter raw\_binary libraries and tools, the convert\_espa\_to\_gtif and convert\_espa\_to\_hdf command-line tools can be used to convert the ESPA internal file format to HDF or GeoTIFF.  Otherwise the data will remain in the ESPA internal file format, which includes each band in the ENVI file format (i.e. raw binary file with associated ENVI header file) and an overall XML metadata file.

## Release Notes
1. Converted the scripts to utilize Python 3, since Python 2.x is obsolete.
2. Allow OLI-only products to be processed for surface reflectance corrections.
3. Support Collection 2 products.
4. Removed the saturation band output in lieu of the Level-1 RADSAT band.
5. Supported L8 and L9.
6. Added some computational efficiences from the LPGS code.
7. Write out data type, scale factor, add offset, etc. similar to the
   Collection 2 products.
8. Support the new pixel QA band from Collection 2.
9. Added Landsat 9 satellite support from the input metadata.
10. Removed the input Level-1 QA which was used to designate clouds, shadows,
    and cirrus. Instead all pixels are considered for aerosol inversion. Cloud,
    shadows, and cirrus are pixels are no longer masked in the aerosol QA band.
11. Pixels which fail the clear land inversion fall into the "water category"
    and are now subject to aerosol inversion for water pixels, similar to the
    original FORTRAN code. If aerosol inversion is successful, these pixels are
    masked with valid aerosol retrieval and as water in the aerosol QA band.
12. Removed pixel size x/y from aerosol interpolation, since it wasn't used.
13. Pixels which fail the aerosol inversion checks are no longer given a default
    value then filled with the median of the clear land pixels. Instead the
    computed aerosol value is used as-is.
14. All pixels are corrected for surface reflectance, except fill. Previously
    cloud pixels were not corrected.
15. Intermediate TOA values are now stored as unscaled, floating point vs. the
    previous scaled uint16 values. Note, this almost doubles the memory usage.
